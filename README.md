Cloning the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/ppieper/Z-Space.git

You may need to do some configuration if you haven't used git before on your machine:

	git config --global user.name "Your Name Here" (this is what shows up in your commits-can be anything you want)
	git config --global user.email your@email.com (this is the email address of your GitHub account)
	
Also please take the time to familiarize yourself with the commands and ask for help if you need to, to prevent any "accidents" 

Commands you should know:

	git branch
	git checkout
	git pull
	git add --all
	git commit -m "Message here"
	git push
	git fetch
	git merge
	
Some of these can mess up things a bit so be sure you know what you're doing beforehand.
